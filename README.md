**Project Overview**

The Band Name Generator is a simple command-line program that:

Greets the user

Asks for the city they grew up in

Asks for their pet’s name

Combines both inputs to suggest a band name

This project intentionally keeps the logic simple to reflect where I was in my learning at the time.

**Why this project exists**

This project helped me learn and practice:

Printing output to the console using print()

Collecting user input using input()

Storing values in variables

String concatenation using +

Understanding program flow from top to bottom

Rather than refactoring or improving the code, I keep it unchanged to showcase my growth across projects.

**How the code works (step-by-step)**

The program prints a welcome message.

The user is prompted to enter:

The name of the city they grew up in

Their pet’s name

Both inputs are stored in variables.

The program concatenates the two strings and displays a suggested band name.

**Example Output**

Welcome to the Band Name Generator.

What's the name of the city you grew up in?

London

What's your pet name?

Max

Your band name could be London Max
